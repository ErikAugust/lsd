Today marks the first day out of 365 in 2024. I'm 40. Reflecting back, it's almost a decade since I began running "seriously" in April 2014. This year, I'm drawing inspiration from that to run more than I have in recent years, aiming for a total of 2000 miles. That works out to roughly 5.5 miles daily. Staying fit is vital to me in many ways; I don't feel at my best when I'm inactive.

My objectives for this year extend beyond personal fitness. A key goal is to visit my daughter at least twice, and I'm planning to schedule the first trip this week. I'm also hoping she'll make a trip to Vermont.

Another significant aim for the year is to finally bring [Cronster](https://cronster.app) to life, a project that's been in the pipeline for nearly ten years.

I'm committed to daily journaling and continuing my meditation practice, currently on a 34-day streak. Additionally, I've reached 16 days of [sobriety](https://cronster.app/@erik/sobriety) and plan to keep alcohol at bay.

Regarding my diet, I intend to stick to [keto](https://cronster.app/@erik/ketosis) for most of the year. It not only helps me feel better but also assists in weight management.

I believe these goals are within my reach and entirely achievable.

I'm approaching this year with a sense of optimism. Being easier on myself seems to ironically help achieve my goals. So, here's to a promising start to the new year!
