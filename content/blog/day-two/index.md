Day 1 is in the books. I ran the Breaking Stigma in Stride "virtual" 5K on the Tread. [24:12](https://runsignup.com/Race/Results/103197#resultSetId-411775;perpage:100). About 5-6 (!) minutes slower than I have in the past, but didn't strain too hard to get it. Also, I'm in keto.

I read a [tweet](https://x.com/Suhail/status/1741723975330492785?s=20) yesterday that inspired me a bit. It was from Brian Armstrong of Coinbase. He wrote that you should visualize where you want to be in five years and worry about the things that will get you closer to that, and also avoid the things that don't get you closer to that goal. I think that is powerful and I will try to remind myself every day to take that approach.

So, where do I want to be in five years? I want to be working on Cronster full-time and running 100 mile races. That's where I want to be. Do I think I will get there? Why not? The last several years I have been figuring out how to get by. I think I have figured that out. Now it's time to focus and get after it.
