Yesterday I ran for the first time since getting COVID. 1 hour in Zone 2. I hit 146 HR right at the 1 hour mark. 10 min/mi. 6 miles. I'm liking this slower pace for my easy runs. I feel less beat up. I'm definitely excited about building a base. Staying healthy is the key for me, so I have to be careful. I'm 40 now, and had a string of injuries in the past 5 years.

A lot of my work is going to be on the treadmill, but I think I am going to force myself to get outside one day a week. Running in the cold is not such a big deal, and it'd be smart to get some ground under my feet.

I'll probably continue some refinement today on [Cronster](https://cronster.app). I feel like I have clarified my goals and that has really helped to make getting things done easier for me.

If all goes well, I'm going to do the [White Lake Ultras 24 Hour](https://ultrasignup.com/entrants_event.aspx?did=109471). A low key, New England event like that will be the perfect introduction to that kind of distance.
